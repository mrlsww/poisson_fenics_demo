# poisson_fenics_demo
Simple Poisson PDE solved with FEniCS

----------------------------------------

This project solves the Poisson equation

-Δu = f on the unit square  
u = 0 on the boundary

with manufactured solution  
u = sin(πx) sin(πy).

## Features
- finite element method (FEM)
- Dirichlet boundary conditions
- comparison with exact solution
- visualization in matplotlib
